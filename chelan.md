Chelan cherries, otherwise known as "black cherries," grow in the Pacific Northwest and ripen early, beating out Bing cherries by up to two weeks (mid-June). This round sweet cherry is also firm in texture and mild in taste. Similar to Bing cherries, Chelan cherries carry a deep mahogany color and sweet flavor. This variety is less susceptible to rain cracking, allowing it a longer shelf life than that of its counterpart.
