Like many types of sweet cherries, Bing cherries have a distinctive heart shape. This variety is usually the first to show up in national markets, as they are the leading commercial sweet cherry. In fact, Bings are so popular that in Washington state, where most American cherries are grown, they are used to measure the growing season of other varieties. Cherry seasons are described as a number of days before or after Bings (for example, two weeks before Bing).

Firm, juicy, and large, Bing cherries range in color from a deep red to rich mahogany when ripe. Bing cherries are intensely sweet with a vibrant aftertaste.
